In the world of PokerFi, the BTC ecological economic model has completely transcended the real physical world:It is based on smart contracts and hashrate to guarantee the underlying trust mechanism, and re-evolves on the chain in an innovative way with card slots as mining sites, NFT poker cards as mining machines, and card slot energy fees as electricity bills, and maximizes the creation of a more open, free, fair and decentralized blockchain digital currency system through operational mechanisms such as card slot auction and NFT poker card blind box purchase. It will create a new starting point for a more open, free, fair and decentralized blockchain digital economic system and a new and more prosperous blockchain development industry.",
